  + MODELS - Build a model with attributes and actions
  + MODELS - Understand what attr_accessors are and how to use them
  + SINATRA - Understand why we use the MVC file structure and how models fit into it
  + CONTROLLERS - Understand why we need controllers (to set up routes and connect data from models to views)
  + CONTROLLLERS - Build GET request routes
  + CONTROLLERS - Connect specific routes to erb templates
  + CONTROLLERS - Connect information from models to views via controller and instance variables
  + VIEW - Understand how to create an erb template file (and how it is similar to an HTML file)
  + VIEWS - Understand what the `yield` statement in layout.erb does and why we use it
  + VIEWS - Understand why we  use instance variables in our views
  + VIEW - Understand how to use erb tags and instance variables to display dynamic information in views
  + SINATRA - Boot up server via rackup and run their app
  + SINATRA - Understand why we need a config.ru file
  + SINATRA - Understand what goes into the public folder, gemfile and config folder (environment configurations)
